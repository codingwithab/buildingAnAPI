# buildingAnAPI

## What is this project?

This project was inspired to help me further improve my understanding and knowledge of REST APIs. I created an API using the following tech stack:

- Express
- Node

## API Repository

This specific repository has code that uses express and listens to the localhost port.

This also includes the **GET** request and **POST** response.
